#Welcome to World Explorer
World explorer is a small 3D application, using the [Irrlicht Engine]
(http://irrlicht.sourceforge.net/), that shows how my procedural generation
library, [libProcgen](https://github.com/callumW/libProcgen), can be used to
create 3D worlds.

This application is created for my 4th year honours project: **Procedurally
Generated 3D Worlds for Video Games** as a part of my Computing Science &
Mathematics degree from the [University of Stirling](http://www.stir.ac.uk).
